# Murder_Mystery_Detective
This project was the 2nd challenge in the Data Analytics Super League Season 1. My SQL knowledge was really tested in the course of taking the challenge and I'm happy I advanced to level 3. 
One exciting thing about data analysis for me is acting like a detective, exploring your data to find answers that no one knew was there. 
There was crime at SQL City. The crime happened on the 15th of January 2018 at The Funky Grooves Tour event. 
Someone was murdered and it was my job as the data analyst detective to find who committed the crime. 
After my investigation, I found out who committed the murder, more details on the murderer below.
